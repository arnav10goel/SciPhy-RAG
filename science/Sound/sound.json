Therefore, the time taken for one complete cycle (T) can be calculated as: T = 39 s / 1258 cycles. The distance traveled by one complete cycle (wavelength, \u03bb) is given by the formula: \u03bb = speed * T, where speed is the speed of sound. Since the first crest is 1423 m away from the source, the distance traveled by a complete cycle (\u03bb) can be expressed as: \u03bb = 1423 m + 1423 m = 2 * 1423 m. Substituting the value of \u03bb and T into the equation, we can calculate the speed of sound: speed = \u03bb / T = (2 * 1423 m) / (39 s / 1258 cycles). Calculating this expression will give us the speed of sound."

In 65 seconds, 1150 crests and 1150 troughs are produced. This means that one complete cycle of the wave (a crest and a trough) occurs 1150 times in 65 seconds. Therefore, the time taken for one complete cycle (T) can be calculated as: T = 65 s / 1150 cycles. The distance traveled by one complete cycle (wavelength, \u03bb) is given by the formula: \u03bb = speed * T, where speed is the speed of sound. Since the first crest is 952 m away from the source, the distance traveled by a complete cycle (\u03bb) can be expressed as: \u03bb = 952 m + 952 m = 2 * 952 m.

Similarly, the time taken by the sound wave to travel the same distance in material-2 can be calculated using: time in material-2 = distance / speed in material-2. Substituting the given values into the equations, we have: time in material-1 = 4 m / 493 m/, time in material-2 = 4 m / 9375 m/s. Therefore, the ratio of the time taken by the sound wave to travel a distance of 4 m in material-1 and material-2 is: Ratio of time = (4 m / 493 m/s) / (4 m / 9375 m/s)= 19.016227180527384"
