The half-life (T) is the time it takes for the activity of a radioactive substance to reduce by half. To find the time required to reduce the activity to a certain percentage (p), we can use the formula: t = T * log(0.01) / log(p/100), where t is the time required, T is the half-life, and p is the desired percentage."
