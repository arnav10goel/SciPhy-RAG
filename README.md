# SciPhy-RAG

- This project aims to apply techniques from the domain of controllable scientific text generation to <b> High School Physics </b>
- The main idea behind the research project stems from the hypothesis that Physics Word Problems (PWPs) require understanding of concepts based on physics formulae and is thus a fundamentally different task from Math Word Problems (MWPs).
