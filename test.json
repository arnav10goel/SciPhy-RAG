The formula to calculate the capacitance is C = (8.854 * 10**-12 * epsilon_r * A) / d, where epsilon_r is the relative permittivity of the medium between the plates (air in this case). The electric field between the plates of a capacitor is determined by the potential difference (V) applied across the plates and the distance between them (d). The formula to calculate the electric field is E = V / d. When a mica sheet is inserted between the plates, the distance between the plates is effectively reduced to half (2 * d). The capacitance with the mica sheet can be calculated using the same formula as before, but with the relative permittivity of mica (epsilon_r_mica). To summarize, inserting a mica sheet between the plates of the capacitor will decrease the distance between the plates, resulting in an increased capacitance compared to the air-filled capacitor.

In 63 seconds, 927 crests and 927 troughs are produced. This means that one complete cycle of the wave (a crest and a trough) occurs 927 times in 63 seconds. Therefore, the time taken for one complete cycle (T) can be calculated as: T = 63 s / 927 cycles. The distance traveled by one complete cycle (wavelength, \u03bb) is given by the formula: \u03bb = speed * T, where speed is the speed of sound. Since the first crest is 1870 m away from the source, the distance traveled by a complete cycle (\u03bb) can be expressed as: \u03bb = 1870 m + 1870 m = 2 * 1870 m. Substituting the value of \u03bb and T into the equation, we can calculate the speed of sound: speed = \u03bb / T = (2 * 1870 m) / (63 s / 927 cycles).

The distance traveled by one complete cycle (wavelength, \u03bb) is given by the formula: \u03bb = speed * T, where speed is the speed of sound. Since the first crest is 1265 m away from the source, the distance traveled by a complete cycle (\u03bb) can be expressed as: \u03bb = 1265 m + 1265 m = 2 * 1265 m. Substituting the value of \u03bb and T into the equation, we can calculate the speed of sound: speed = \u03bb / T = (2 * 1265 m) / (19 s / 449 cycles).
